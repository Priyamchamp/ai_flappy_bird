# ai_flappy_bird
the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) framework, which is a method for evolving artificial neural networks using genetic algorithms. NEAT is often used in reinforcement learning scenarios, like training agents to play games.
If you intended to use NEAT for training a neural network to play the game, you need to set up NEAT, define the neural network architecture, and implement the genetic algorithm for evolving the networks over generations.

# Install NEAT-Python:
You can install NEAT-Python using pip:
pip install neat-python
# Define NEAT Configuration:
Create a NEAT configuration file or use the default parameters. You can specify details like the population size, mutation rates, and other evolutionary parameters.
# Create a NEAT Genome and Neural Network:
Define a NEAT genome for representing individuals in the population. Each genome corresponds to a neural network. Create a neural network based on the genome structure.
# Integrate NEAT into the Game Loop:
During each iteration of the game loop, evaluate the performance of each individual in the population using the neural network. Assign fitness based on the performance.
# Here's a very simplified and general example of how you might integrate NEAT into your game loop:
import neat

# Define the NEAT configuration
config_path = "path/to/neat_config_file.txt"
config = neat.config.Config(neat.DefaultGenome, neat.DefaultReproduction,
                            neat.DefaultSpeciesSet, neat.DefaultStagnation, config_path)

# Create the NEAT population
population = neat.Population(config)

# Run the NEAT evolution for a specified number of generations
for gen in range(num_generations):
    for _, genome in population:
        # Create a neural network from the genome
        net = neat.nn.FeedForwardNetwork.create(genome, config)

        # Evaluate the fitness of the network (play the game)
        fitness = play_game_with_neural_network(net)

        # Assign fitness to the genome
        genome.fitness = fitness

    # Evolve to the next generation
    population.evolve()
